TESTED
-----

Working in Backdrop 1.3 but requires manual integration of the code library or the Wow.JS So Impress demo setting to see the effects of this.

KNOWN ISSUES
---------------------

Your project may or may not fall under the license/terms of usage.  Please read: https://github.com/matthieua/WOW

This module is not https://www.drupal.org/project/wowjs because it is easier to start a new module to work more simply within the Backdrop CMS system.

4. In your Javascript file you can write the code based on this API to do what you want.
5. Visit the configuration page and choose which pages of your website you want the effects to take place on.

COMING FROM DRUPAL?
-------------------

This module is not https://www.drupal.org/project/wowjs because it is easier to start a new module to work more simply within the Backdrop CMS system than to rewrite the codebase.  There comes a point in which support for two very different codebases for one small project would confuse people.

PERMISSIONS
------------

none

USAGE
-----

Reveal CSS animation as you scroll down a page. By default, you can use it to trigger animate.css animations. But you can easily change the settings to your favorite animation library.

Advantages:

Smaller than other JavaScript parallax plugins

Super simple to install, and works with animate.css, so if you already use it, that will be very fast to setup

Fast execution and lightweight code: the browser will like it

You can change the settings easily (see the /js/demo.js file for an example that you can modify).
